MKAuto, a simple AutoHotKey script to farm towers in Mortal Kombat 11's Towers of Time (or Klassic Towers), using Remote Play to connect to your console.

How to Use:

1. Run Remote Play on your PC, and connect to your PS4 or PS5
2. Start the tower you want to complete
3. Run the script. The script clicks continue after each match is done

A few notes:

-Wait until you've begun the first match to run the script
-Hit Alt to pause/unpause the script
-When first run, the script will delay for 3 seconds before starting, giving you time to Alt-Tab back into the application.
-If Sony changes the name of the 'PS Remote Play' application (it's happened once before), simply edit the script and change the name of the paramenter on Line 8 after '#IfWinActive'.
